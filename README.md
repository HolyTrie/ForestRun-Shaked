## Changes
I used some of the base code for this project from my previous project - [SpaceShips](https://github.com/HolyTrie/SpaceShips-Shaked/tree/main) </br>
i'll list the most significant changes made in this project below : </br>
* I created a character controller with animation in order to controll the player movement [CharacterController](https://github.com/HolyTrie/ForestRun-Shaked/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/1-movers/CharacterController.cs) 
* Created movement for the player, which is basically keybinding assign [Movement](https://github.com/HolyTrie/ForestRun-Shaked/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/1-movers/Movement.cs)
* Created move camera for the player to follow it from a certain angle and position [MoveCameraVertical](https://github.com/HolyTrie/ForestRun-Shaked/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/MoveCameraVertical.cs)
